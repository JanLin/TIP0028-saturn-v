## Saturn-V TIP { #index-saturn-v-tip }

The **Saturn-V** TIP is a
[recommendation](#https:--trustoverip.github.io-deliverables-process-work_products--recommendations)
of the ToIP Foundation.

A *ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP)* is a deliverable of the [ToIP
Technology Stack Working
Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group).

### Audience { #index-audience }

ToIP Layer 4 Ecosystem Projects that follow the guidance of the [ToIP
Ecosystem Foundry Working
Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/EFWG+Concepts+and+Workflow)
will make decisions during the `DEFINE` and `CREATE` workflow swimlanes
that will allow them to articulate specific technology requirements.
They can use these requirements to help in their selection of which ToIP
TIP they seek to leverage.

Figure 1: ToIP EFWG Workflow Swimlanes

As stakeholders in a specific Ecosystem Project consider the various
technology ingredients associates with a solution architecture, they may
appreciate the guidance of ToIP TIPs that have formulated a very
specific solution recipe containing a profile of use cases backed by
technology that has been implemented and tested by a community of
vendors.

The Saturn-V TIP represents one such solution recipe.

### Name { #index-name }

This TIP represents the next evolutionary step towards the *moon shot*
known as decentralized identity. Acknowledging the [recently successful
NASA/Space-X
mission](https://www.cnet.com/news/spacex-splashdown-replay-see-nasa-astronauts-safely-return-to-earth-from-iss/)
that has revitalized attention to space exploration, history reveals
that our early success in space was significantly aided by the **Saturn
V** multi-stage rocket platform. The *Saturn V* three-stage rocket
served as a *Heavy Lift Vehicle* for space exploration. It was the most
powerful rocket that had ever flown successfully. The *Saturn V* was
used in the Apollo program in the 1960s and 1970s. It also was used to
launch the Skylab space station. Containing three (3) powerful
fuel-stages, this massive rocket was used to propel man to the moon.

Since we are in the early stages of the technology adoption lifecycle
for decentralized identity, we seek a technical architecture (recipe) to
bootstrap an interoperable digital trust marketplace. Analogous to the
first three layers of the ToIP Technology Stack, this TIP represents an
exemplar of a technical collaboration to help propel decentralized
identity into mainstream adoption.

![toip-stack](https://trustoverip.github.io/WP0010-toip-foundation-whitepaper/images/toip_layer4.png)

In fact the *Saturn V* project required that three separate companies,
each responsible for a separate fuel-stage, collaborated to integrate
their fuel-engines into [a single interoperable rocket
platform](https://www.space.com/18422-apollo-saturn-v-moon-rocket-nasa-infographic.html)
that would propel the Appolo and Skylab missions. Today, we seek to
integrate technology for three ToIP Layers to achieve a common goal â€“
**help propel the adoption of digital credentials**.

## Purpose { #index-purpose }

Today, the decentralized identity community continues the *moon shot*
started by the *Sovrin Foundation* towards self-sovereign identity. This
proposal is unique as it represents a vertical interoperable stack that
is already familiar to most industry participants. This proposal is
effectively receiving the baton that began with the Sovrin Network and
will focus on evolving that effort into a network of networks model.

## Key Motivators { #index-key-motivators }

<font color='cyan'>List the reasons that triggered the proposal.</font>

1.  We need to describe an example TIP that is of interest to many in
    the ToIP Foundation.
2.  As the Sovrin Community transitions under the broader umbrella of
    the ToIP Foundation, we need a description of the architecture in
    which the community desires to embrace.  
3.  We need a methodology that will allow alternative TIPs to be
    compared to the one most familiar with many in the ToIP Foundation.
4.  We need a forum for the [Indy
    Interop-athon](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=36734079)
    events that are focused on making the network of networks concepts
    reality of public identity utilities based on Hyperledger Indy.

## Use cases to be validated { #use_cases-use-cases-to-be-validated }

In addition to the common business patterns associated with
decentralized identity, namely `password-less auth` and `digital
onboarding`, this TIP will [build on existing
proof-points](https://sovrin.org/category/use-cases/) to establish a
generalized list of uses-cases that will help to demonstrate
cross-industry adoption.

## Core Principles { #design_principles-core-principles }

This TIP provides a set of gGuidelines for how market requirements
should be translated into architecture and technology decisions.

Evaluators of this TIP should look at each of these suggested design
principles and consider the ramifications for supporting or
not-supporting each.

The vendors supporting this TIP have incorporated these design
principles into their software solutions.

### Laws of Identity { #design_principles-laws-of-identity }

The seven (7) principles outlined by in 2006 and captured in the ToIP
Design Principle Recommendation - [DP0003: Laws of
Identity](https://github.com/trustoverip/deliverables/blob/main/recommendations/DP0003-laws-of-identity/DP0003-laws-of-identity.md)
are foundational principles for this TIP.

### Privacy by design { #design_principles-privacy-by-design }

The seven (7) principles outlined by in the ToIP Design Principle
Recommendation - [DP0004: Privacy by
Design](https://github.com/trustoverip/deliverables/blob/main/recommendations/DP0004-privacy-by-design/DP0004-privacy-by-design.md)
are foundational principles for this TIP.

### Self-sovereign identity (SSI) { #design_principles-self-sovereign-identity-ssi }

This TIP is purpose built to provide the foundational infrastructure
necessary to support the [10 Core
Principles](#https:--docs.google.com-document-d-1wquoqdtbc3jacilrvijowjrcjhtntnzk9_as9v-jwry-edit-heading=h.ws45zwyr4hfb)
that were adopted by the [Sovrin Foundation](http://sovrin.org) in
support of SSI.

| Principle        | Description                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Existence        | Users must have an independent existence.                      |
| Control          | Users must control their identities.                           |
| Access           | Users must have access to their own data.                      |
| Transparency     | Systems and algorithms must be transparent.                    |
| Persistence      | Identities must be long-lived.                                 |
| Portability      | Information and services about identity must be transportable. |
| Interoperability | Identities should be as widely usable as possible.             |
| Consent          | Users must agree to the use of their identity.                 |
| Minimization     | Disclosure of claims must be minimized.                        |
| Protection       | The rights of users must be protected.                         |

### Decentralization by Design { #design_principles-decentralization-by-design }

The ToIP Design Principle Recommendation - [DP0005: Decentralization by
Design](https://github.com/trustoverip/deliverables/blob/main/recommendations/DP0005-decentralization-by-design/DP0005-decentralization-by-design.md)
provides a spectrum of considerations to be considered when solution
architectures are contemplating the degree of decentralization that is
required.

This TIP minimally specifies that the root of trust MUST be managed in a
decentralized manner, preferably by one or more decentralized public
identity utilities.

When the technology has matured, this TIP will be modified to REQUIRE
stronger decentralization technics for the root of trust by combining a
decentralized ledger with [Key Event Receipt Infrastructure
(KERI)](https://keri.one/). Refer to [advancements in the Indy DID
Method](https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw).
