## Saturn-V TIP

The __Saturn-V__ TIP is a [recommendation](https://trustoverip.github.io/deliverables/process/work_products/#recommendations) of the ToIP Foundation.

A _ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP)_ is a deliverable of the [ToIP Technology Stack Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group).

### Audience
ToIP Layer 4 Ecosystem Projects that follow the guidance of the [ToIP Ecosystem Foundry Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/EFWG+Concepts+and+Workflow)
will make decisions during the `DEFINE` and `CREATE` workflow swimlanes that will allow them to articulate specific technology requirements. They can use these requirements to help in their selection of which ToIP TIP they seek to leverage.

As stakeholders in a specific Ecosystem Project consider the various technology ingredients associates with a solution architecture, they may appreciate the guidance of ToIP TIPs that have formulated a very specific solution recipe containing a profile of use cases backed by technology that has been implemented and tested by a community of vendors.

The Saturn-V TIP represents one such solution recipe.

### Name
This TIP represents the next evolutionary step towards the *moon shot* known as decentralized identity. Acknowledging the [recently successful NASA/Space-X mission](https://www.cnet.com/news/spacex-splashdown-replay-see-nasa-astronauts-safely-return-to-earth-from-iss/) that has revitalized attention to space exploration, history reveals that our early success in space was significantly aided by the **Saturn V** multi-stage rocket platform. The *Saturn V* three-stage rocket served as a *Heavy Lift Vehicle* for space exploration. It was the most powerful rocket that had ever flown successfully. The *Saturn V* was used in the Apollo program in the 1960s and 1970s. It also was used to launch the Skylab space station.  Containing three (3) powerful fuel-stages, this massive rocket was used to propel man to the moon.

Since we are in the early stages of the technology adoption lifecycle for decentralized identity, we seek a technical architecture (recipe) to bootstrap an interoperable digital trust marketplace. Analogous to the first three layers of the ToIP Technology Stack, this TIP represents an exemplar of a technical collaboration to help propel decentralized identity into mainstream adoption.

In fact the *Saturn V* project required that three separate companies, each responsible for a separate fuel-stage, collaborated to integrate their fuel-engines into [a single interoperable rocket platform](https://www.space.com/18422-apollo-saturn-v-moon-rocket-nasa-infographic.html) that would propel the Appolo and Skylab missions. Today, we seek to integrate technology for three ToIP Layers to achieve a common goal -- **help propel the adoption of digital credentials**.

## Purpose
Today, the decentralized identity community continues the *moon shot* started by the *Sovrin Foundation* towards self-sovereign identity. This proposal is unique as it represents a vertical interoperable stack that is already familiar to most industry participants. This proposal is effectively receiving the baton that began with the Sovrin Network and will focus on evolving that effort into a network of networks model.

## Key Motivators
<font color='cyan'>List the reasons that triggered the proposal.</font>

1. We need to describe an example TIP that is of interest to many in the ToIP Foundation.
2. As the Sovrin Community transitions under the broader umbrella of the ToIP Foundation, we need a description of the architecture in which the community desires to embrace.   
3. We need a methodology that will allow alternative TIPs to be compared to the one most familiar with many in the ToIP Foundation.
4. We need a forum for the
[Indy Interop-athon](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=36734079) events that are focused on making the network of networks concepts reality of public identity utilities based on Hyperledger Indy.
