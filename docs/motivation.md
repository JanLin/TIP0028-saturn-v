## Common Ground

The stakeholders endorsing this TIP all agree to some basic commmon concepts:

* _Interoperability_ is fundamental for success
* _Peer-to-Peer Testing_ provides real-world validation and viability of standards and technology
* _Peer Certification_ between vendors is just-good-enough

## Continuity

The stakeholders endorsing this TIP:

1. Desire a formal articulation of the technical stack (**recipe**) they will support and advocate with clients.
2. Understands the need for a network neutral description of the architecture many often associate with the Sovrin Community.   
3. Require a methodology that will allow alternative TIPs to be compared to the one most familiar with many in the ToIP Foundation.
4. Embrace a formal Task Force approach as a transition from the work originally started in the [Indy Interop-athon](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=36734079) where the focus was on making the network of networks concepts a reality for public identity utilities based on Hyperledger Indy.
