ToIP Layer 4 Ecosystem Projects that follow the guidance of the [ToIP Ecosystem Foundry Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/EFWG+Concepts+and+Workflow)
will make decisions during the `DEFINE` and `CREATE` workflow swimlanes that will allow them to articulate specific technology requirements. They can use these requirements to help in their selection of which ToIP TIP they seek to leverage.

As stakeholders in a specific Ecosystem Project consider the various technology ingredients associates with a solution architecture, they may appreciate the guidance of ToIP TIPs that have formulated a very specific solution recipe containing a profile of use cases backed by technology that has been implemented and tested by a community of vendors.

The Saturn-V TIP represents one such solution recipe.
