### TIP Support Proclamation

iGrant.io believes vendor interoperability is fundamental for Self-Sovereign Identity solutions based on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), a new digital identity standard. This only can be achieved through interoperability tests promoted by this group under the Saturn-V project. We are committed to ensure our products interwork with other suppliers. Please contact us if you want to perform interop testing with any of our products.

The [Aries playground](https://docs.igrant.io/ssi/ssi-apg) environment, makes it easy for developers to issue Verifiable Credentials on behalf of an organisation (Data Source). These credentials can be used by individuals to prove their data to any Data Using Service.

The [Aries mobile agent](https://docs.igrant.io/ssi/ssi-ama) is a fully functional open source mobile agent supporting Aries Interoperability Profile (RFC0302). A demo over the iGrant.io Data Wallet app may be downloaded from [Apple App Store or Google Play](https://igrant.io/datawallet.html).
