### TIP Support Proclamation
IBM believes wholeheartedly in the principles of Self Sovereign Identity where users own their PII as digital assets which
they selectively disclose on a need-to-know basis.

IBM also strongly supports open standards and interoperability which allows users to choose the best solution without being locked into a single vendor.

This is the reason IBM actively supports projects like Saturn V, which improves interoperability and welcomes other vendors to join in building a truly interoperable ecosystem.
