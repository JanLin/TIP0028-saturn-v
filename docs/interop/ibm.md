### TIP Support Proclamation

IBM believes wholeheartedly in the principles of Self Sovreign Identity where users own their PII as digital assets which 
they selectively disclose on a need-to-know basis.
IBM also strongly supports open standards and interoperability which allows users to choose the best solution
without being locked into a single vendor.
This is the reason IBM actively supports projects like Saturn V, which improves interoperability and welcomes other vendors to join in building a truly interoperable ecosystem.
