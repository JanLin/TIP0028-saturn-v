# To Do Items

## Document Outline
The _Saturn-V TIP Task Force_ ("TF") has decided (see [Issue 12](https://github.com/trustoverip/TIP0028-saturn-v/issues/12)) that we should only reveal document sections that have content. The content does not need to be final (draft content is acceptable) but we should not expose empty sections.

This raises the topic of our **desired document outline**.

See [Issue 16](https://github.com/trustoverip/TIP0028-saturn-v/issues/16).
